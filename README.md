# Employee Management

Employee Management allows Users to add employee and their details.<br>
This comes with authentication using spring security.<br>
Users need to verify their email to be able to acces the data.<br>
A verification mail will be send to them when Users signup.<br>
The Authentication works by Jwt token.<br>
A token is generated when a user successfully logged in.<br>
Every time the user try to acces the API, the Jwt is validated and allowd for futhur process.<br><br>

This project is built using Java Spring Boot.<br>
Postgres as Database.
